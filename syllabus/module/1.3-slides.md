# Ownership

---

## Basic memory refresh

- Memory is stored using binary
  - Bits: 0 or 1
- Computer optimized for bytes
  - 1 byte == 8 contiguous bits
- Fully contiguous

---

## Addresses

- All data in memory has an “address”
  - Used to locate data
  - Always the same – only data changes
- Usually don’t utilize addresses directly
  - Variables handle most of the work

---

## Offsets

- Items can be located at an address using an “offset”
- Offsets begin at 0
- Represent the number of bytes away from the original address
  - Normally deal with indexes instead

---

## The Stack

- LIFO Structure
- Automatic Memory Management
- Fast Allocation
- Scope-Bound
- Size Limitations
- Suitable for Temporary Data

---

## The Heap

- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Greater Flexibility
- Larger Memory Area
- Fragmentation
- Slower Allocation
- Lifetime Management

---

## What Is Ownership?

- Ownership is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory
- Rust's ownership system is built on three main rules:
  - Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
  - There can only be one owner at a time.
  - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

---

## Managing memory

- Programs must track memory
  - If they fail to do so, a “leak” occurs
- Rust utilizes an “ownership” model to manage memory
  - The “owner” of memory is responsible for cleaning up the memory
- Memory can either be “moved” or “borrowed”

---

## Example - Move

```rust
enum Light {
    Bright,
    Dull,
}

fn display_light(light: Light) {
    match light {
        Light::Bright => println!("bright"),
        Light::Dull => println!("dull"),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dull = Light::Dull;
    display_light(dull);
    display_light(dull);
}

```

---

## Example - Borrow

```rust
enum Light {
    Bright,
    Dull,
}

fn display_light(light: &Light) {
    match light {
        Light::Bright => println!("bright"),
        Light::Dull => println!("dull"),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dull = Light::Dull;
    display_light(&dull);
    display_light(&dull);
}

```

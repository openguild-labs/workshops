# Common Data Structures

---

## Enumeration

- Data that can be one of multiple different possibilities
  - Each possibility is called a “variant”
- Provides information about your program to the compiler
  - More robust programs

---

## Example

```rust
enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
}

fn which_way(go: Direction) -> &'static str {
    match go {
        Direction::Up => "up",
        Direction::Down => "down",
        Direction::Left => "left",
        Direction::Right => "right",
    }
}
```

---

## Structure

- A type that contains multiple pieces of data
  - All or nothing – cannot have some pieces of data and not others
- Each piece of data is called a “field”
- Makes working with data easier
  - Similar data can be grouped together

---

## Example

```rust
struct ShippingBox {
    depth: i32,
    width: i32,
    height: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let my_box = ShippingBox {
        depth: 3,
        width: 2,
        height: 5,
    };

    let tall = my_box.height;
    println!("the box is {:?} units tall", tall);
}
```

---

## Tuples

- A type of “record”
- Store data anonymously
  - No need to name fields
- Useful to return pairs of data from functions
- Can be “destructured” easily into variables

---

## Example

```rust
enum Access {
    Full,
}

fn one_two_three() -> (i32, i32, i32) {
    (1, 2, 3)
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = one_two_three();
    let (x, y, z) = one_two_three();
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", x, numbers.0); // 1
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", y, numbers.1); // 2
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", z, numbers.2); // 3

    let (employee, access) = ("Jake", Access::Full);
}
```

---

## Expressions

- Rust is an expression-based language
  - Most things are evaluated and return some value
- Expression values coalesce to a single point
  - Can be used for nesting logic

---

## Example

```rust
let my_num = 3;
let is_lt_5 = if my_num < 5 {
    true
} else {
    false
};

let is_lt_5 = my_num < 5;
```

---

## Example

```rust
let my_num = 3;
let message = match my_num {
    1 => "hello",
    _ => "goodbye"
};
```

---

## Example

```rust
enum Menu {
    Burger,
    Fries,
    Drink,
}

let paid = true;
let item = Menu::Drink;
let drink_type = "water";
let order_placed = match item {
    Menu::Drink => {
        if drink_type == "water" {
            true
        } else {
            false
        }
    },
    _ => true,
};

```

---

## Option

- A type that may be one of two things
  - Some data of a specified type
  - Nothing
- Used in scenarios where data may not be required or is unavailable
  - Unable to find something
  - Ran out of items in a list
  - Form field not filled out

---

## Definition

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

```

## Example

```rust
struct Customer {
    age: Option<i32>,
    email: String,
}

let mark = Customer {
    age: Some(22),
    email: "mark@example.com".to_owned(),
};

let becky = Customer {
    age: None,
    email: "becky@example.com".to_owned(),
};

match becky.age {
    Some(age) => println!("customer is {} years old", age),
    None => println!("customer age not provided"),
}
```

---

## Example

```rust
struct GroceryItem {
    name: String,
    qty: i32,
}

fn find_quantity(name: &str) -> Option<i32> {
    let groceries = vec![
        GroceryItem { name: "bananas".to_owned(), qty: 4 },
        GroceryItem { name: "eggs".to_owned(), qty: 12 },
        GroceryItem { name: "bread".to_owned(), qty: 1 },
    ];

    for item in groceries {
        if item.name == name {
            return Some(item.qty);
        }
    }

    None
}
```

---

## Result

- A data type that contains one of two types of data:
  - “Successful” data
  - “Error” data
- Used in scenarios where an action needs to be taken, but has the possibility of failure
  - Copying a file
  - Connecting to a website

---

## Definition

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

---

## Example

```rust
struct SoundData {
    // assuming SoundData has a field called `name`
    name: String,
}

impl SoundData {
    fn new(name: &str) -> SoundData {
        SoundData {
            name: name.to_owned(),
        }
    }
}

fn get_sound(name: &str) -> Result<SoundData, String> {
    if name == "alert" {
        Ok(SoundData::new("alert"))
    } else {
        Err("unable to find sound data".to_owned())
    }
}

fn main() {
    let sound = get_sound("alert");
    match sound {
        Ok(_) => println!("sound data located"),
        Err(e) => println!("error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

---

## Vector

- Multiple pieces of data
  - Must be the same type
- Used for lists of information
- Can add, remove, and traverse the entries

---

## Example

```rust
let my_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];

let mut my_numbers = Vec::new();
my_numbers.push(1);
my_numbers.push(2);
my_numbers.push(3);
my_numbers.pop();
let length = my_numbers.len(); // this is 2

let two = my_numbers[1];
```

---

## Example

```rust
let my_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];

for num in my_numbers {
    println!("{:?}", num);
}
```

---

## String and &str

- Two commonly used types of strings
  - String - owned
  - &str – borrowed String slice
- Must use an owned String to store in a struct
- Use &str when passing to a function

---

## Example – Pass to function

```rust
fn print_it(data: &str) {
    println!("{:?}", data);
}

fn main() {
    print_it("a string slice");
    let owned_string = "owned string".to_owned();
    let another_owned = String::from("another");
    print_it(&owned_string);
    print_it(&another_owned);
}
```

---

## Example – Will not work

```rust
struct Employee {
    name: &'static str,
}

fn main() {
    let emp_name = "Jayson";
    let emp = Employee {
        name: emp_name,
    };
}
```

---

## Example – Works!

```rust
struct Employee {
    name: String,
}

fn main() {
    let emp_name = "Jayson".to_owned();
    let emp = Employee {
        name: emp_name
    };
}

```

---

## Hashmap

- Collection that stores data as key-value pairs
  - Data is located using the “key”
  - The data is the “value”
- Similar to definitions in a dictionary
- Very fast to retrieve data using the key

---

## Example: find data

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut people = HashMap::new();
    people.insert("Susan", 21);
    people.insert("Ed", 13);
    people.insert("Will", 14);
    people.insert("Cathy", 22);
    people.remove("Susan");

    match people.get("Ed") {
        Some(age) => println!("age = {:?}", age),
        None => println!("not found"),
    }
}

```

---

## Example: iterate

```rust
for (person, age) in people.iter() {
    println!("person = {:?}, age = {:?}", person, age);
}

for person in people.keys() {
    println!("person = {:?}", person);
}

for age in people.values() {
    println!("age = {:?}", age);
}

```
